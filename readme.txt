This plugin detects native WordPress feeds and redirects them to your FeedBurner feed so you can track your subscribers.

== Description == 

This plugin redirects all requests for your native WordPress feeds to your Feedburner feeds so you can track all your subscribers and maximize your results and user engagement.

You can redirect both your main WordPress feed and your comments feed if you like. (Comments feed is optional since not everyone uses it.)

This plugin is a fork of the FeedBurner Feedsmith plugin. Since it was discontinued, I picked up where it left off so we all can have an actively updated plugin.

Features:

* Simple to use
* Fast
* Compatible

One of the **easiest** ways to implement your Feedburner feed on your WordPress site. *It just works.*

= What options do I need to fill in? =

After you sign up for a Feedburner account, just fill in your Feedburner feed address, and click *Save Settings*. That's all! After that it will work.

Optional: If you have a Feedburner feed setup for your comments, you can enter that as well, and your comment feed will automatically be redirected too.
