This plugin detects native WordPress feeds and redirects them to your FeedBurner, FeedPress, or FeedBlitz feed so you can track your subscribers.

== Description == 

This plugin redirects all requests for your native WordPress feeds to your FeedBurner, FeedPress, or FeedBlitz feeds so you can track all your subscribers and maximize your blog/site readership and user engagement.

You can redirect both your main WordPress feed and your comments feed if you like. (Comments feed is optional since not everyone uses it.)

This plugin is a fork of the original FeedBurner Feedsmith plugin by Steve Smith. Since it was discontinued, I picked up where it left off so we all can have an actively updated plugin.

As of version 1.4.6, this plugin supports FeedPress and FeedBlitz, popular FeedBurner alternatives.

One of the **easiest** ways to implement your FeedBurner, FeedPress, or FeedBlitz feed on your WordPress site. *It just works.*

= Other Notes =

Important: If you are using a caching plugin, you will need to set it to *not cache* your feeds. (Cache plugins usually have an "exclude" setting so you can specify which pages won't be cached.)

This plugin has not been designed specifically for use with Multisite. It can be used in Multisite if activated *per site*, but *should not* be Network Activated. As with any plugin, test and make sure it works with your particular setup before using on a production site.
