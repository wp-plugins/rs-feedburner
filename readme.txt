This plugin detects native WordPress feeds and redirects them to your FeedBurner feed so you can track your subscribers.

== Description == 

This plugin redirects all requests for your native WordPress feeds to your Feedburner feeds so you can track all your subscribers and maximize your results and user engagement.

You can redirect both your main feed and your comments feed if you like.

This plugin is a fork of the FeedBurner Feedsmith plugin. Since it was discontinued, I picked up where it left off so we all can have an actively updated plugin.
